## Golang Path

#### Things I need to figure out, I am figuring out

1. Pointers
2. Concurrency using go-routines
3. Channels/select
4. Concurrency patterns in Golang
5. Gorilla/MUX
6. Write RESTFUL APIs
7. Create a AWS CDK app
8. Check if Lambda Powertools are available for Golang
9. Create a RESTFUL API project with Golang using Gorilla/MUX



#### Mini Project

The best way to learn anything is by doing it. So, I will start writing an API project with Gorilla/MUX and MYSQL database. This is going to be a very basic E-Commerce CRUD app.

1. User will be able to see items available under catergories.
2. User will be able to log-in/signup using barebone AUTH(N/Z).
3. User will be able to add items to cart
4. User will be able to checkout.

If I spend one hour daily from Mon-Fri. This should take me two weeks tops. I should start this from Wednesday, 17th August 2022. My peek performace time is earliest in the morning. I would love to take it during 8-9 in the morning. Most of the folks are sleeping. Lesser distractions. No mobile phone between 8-9, Insha Allah. May Allah guide us all to the righteous path.
